## User Experience Design (UX)

-   ### The Strategy Plane
-   #### Site Goals
    Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a fun interactive game for people young and old. It is intended for use by all ages, as the game has easy to follow rules and instructions. 

    The game is easy to play, easy to follow and easily navigated by it's players. The main aim of the game is to have fun and try to beat the computer. 

    The target audience covers a huge span of players of all ages. School age children could read and play this game by following the rules listed in the rules section. Equally, it is suitable for an older audience, and in particular, fans of the T.V. show, "The Big Bang Theory". (From which this version of the game originated)

-   #### User Stories

-   ##### First Time Visitor Goals
    
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want a fun and simple game to play
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know the rules of the game.
    
    <br>

-   ##### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find out more about this version of the game.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to interact with the site and use the media player.

    <br>
- ### The Scope Plane
- When creating this game I took an agile approach. That is, creating bite-size increments of development at any one time. I worked at the different sections in smaller chunks. I solved smaller parts of the problem by choosing small elements to work on daily. These smaller sprints of work allowed me to ensure the features I wanted to build were done in a timely fashion and also that I didn't succumb to 'scope creep'.
I have met the functional requirements of the game by allowing the user the opportunity to play the game and also to familiarise themselves with the rules for playing. 
I have met the content requirement of the website by providing the players with a game that functions as intended for fun and enjoyment.
I believe this website is entertaining for the users and it offers them a simple chance game to play against the computer. 

<br>

- ### The Structure Plane

- #### Structure
- I decided to break up the game into two different pages. There is the landing page where the user can play the game and there is the rules page which can be acessed through clicking the "Rules" button on the landing page. There is also a modal used on the game site which conveys the winning choice and the computer's choice after every draw to the player.
I chose to use the modal structure as I felt it was a nice simple way to display the computer's score. The player may then click anywhere outside the modal to return to the game interface.

  I wanted to ensure the structure allowed me to implement the functions and features needed to meet the user story requirements.

    *User Story:*
    
    As a user, I want a fun and simple game to play.

    *Acceptance Criteria:*

    It should be clear that it is a game, what it is about and how to play.

    *Implementation:*

    The chosen colour scheme, accesible layout and typography allow the user to interact with a game that is fun, vibrant and easy on the eye. There are links to the rules on the main game site and also links to a Youtube video explaining the rules further.

    *User Story:*
    
    As a user, I want to know the rules of the game.

    *Acceptance Criteria:*

    The user should be able to see the rules clearly to inform their choice when playing.

    *Implementation:*

    The user can access the rules by clicking the "Rules" button to take them to a diagram explaining the rules. They can see all options and how they may win or loose depending on their choice. 
    
    *User Story:*

    As a user, I want to find out more about this version of the game.
    
    *Acceptance Criteria:*

    The user should be able to gain further understanding of this version of the game through instructions or directions.

    *Implementation:*

    The user will be able to read the rules of the game using the "Rules" page. Users may want more information and    can find this by clicking on the Youtube link to take them to a further oral explanation from the T.V. show "The Big Bang Theory"

    *User Story:*

    As a user, I want to interact with the site and use the media player.

    *Acceptance Criteria:*

    The user should be able to play background music by using the audio controls underneath the game area.

    *Implementation:*

    The user will have the option to play a music clip which incorporates the voice of Spock from T.V. show, Star Trek. This is a nice nod to the "Spock" element of the game - with the audio playing an excerpt from the character Spock. This sets the tone and should provide the player with some light hearted entertainment.


-   ### The Skeleton Plane

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used were chosen from a complimetary color pallete generator online. I wanted the colours to be complimetary but understated and to not draw away from the game. I then chose a plum shade, (#B43E8F) to use as my main text colour, the hover over icon colour and also as my text colour on my buttons. I chose this colour by playing around with the hue of the last colour from my pallete, #CCC9DC. In doing so, I could be sure the colour would offer a contrast to the darker colours, without being harsh or hard to see. 

            ![Color Pallete](images/color-pallete.png)

    -   #### Typography
        -   The "Luckiest Guy "font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Luckiest Guy is a fun and playful font and it struck me as the perfect choice for a simple, fun game. I liked this font and think it brings an element of fun to the look of the site. 

    -   #### Imagery
        -   I chose a simple image of the rules to convey the message to the player. This image was taken from the website [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/#discuss) This website allows for screenshot usage of their information. *Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.*

-  ![JSHint JavaScript Validator](images/jshint-img.png)

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhone.
-   A variety of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs and Errors

#### Errors
- When initially using the HTML validator, I got the following error:
![Button Error Image](images/html-error.png)
I changed the anchor tag to include my href link and took out the button. Instead, I styled the anchor tag to resemble a button and fixed the error.
- I found as it was my first time using JavaScript that I had quite a few extra semicolons that needed to be removed.

#### Bugs
-   On mobile devices initially, the modal showing the results was not closing when the user clicked outside the modal area as was happening on desktop versions.
